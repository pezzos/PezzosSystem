# AGENTS.md

This repository uses the documentation system in `docs/` as the primary source
of context for AI-assisted work. The source of truth is:
- `docs/README.md` for structure and usage
- `docs/00-context/` for product context and system map
- `docs/00-context/context-boundaries-operating-model.md` for scope boundaries, operating model, and MVP stop conditions
- `docs/01-product/` for requirements and success criteria
- `docs/02-features/` for feature-level specs, designs, tasks, and tests
- `docs/03-logs/` for decisions, implementation notes, bugs, and validation
- `docs/04-process/` for workflow and quality standards (ticket implementation must follow `docs/04-process/ticket-execution-protocol.md` and PO loop uses `docs/04-process/human-orchestration-workflow.md`)

Rules:
- Keep diffs small and focused.
- Perform a systematic review: list executed commands and summarize results.
- If context is missing or unclear, ask for the relevant document rather than
  guessing.
- For any ticket implementation, run `make ticket T=<id>` and follow `docs/04-process/ticket-execution-protocol.md`.
- If HIGH RISK, stop after Preflight and set status to "Awaiting PO Approval".

## Setup commands
- None defined. Ask if project-specific setup is required.

## Tests/Lint
- None defined. Ask which commands to run.

## DoD
- Follow `docs/04-process/definition-of-done.md`.

## Git conventions
- Use clear, scoped commit messages.
- Do not amend commits unless explicitly requested.
